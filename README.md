# Customer_propensity_to_purchase

Scoring customer propensity to purchase
Training a model based on a shoppers actions on a website to identify the best prospects who did not purchase yesterday.

Notes : This data is sampled and all UserIDs are dummies.

We have many visitors to our website every day, some purchase but many do not. We spend money re-targeting past visitors, we'd like to optomise this activity by targeting the visitors who are more likely to convert. To do this, we've taken data showing which parts of our website users interacted with, our questions are:-

1.Which of these interactiuons effect a users likelyhood to purchase?
2.Can we score visitors from yesterday who did not purchase, to see who the most valauve prospects are?
